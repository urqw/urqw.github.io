# urqw.github.io

Files in the root directory of the website where the [UrqW](https://github.com/urqw/UrqW/) instance is deployed.

It is assumed that the UrqW instance is located in the urqw.github.io/UrqW directory, and these files are in the root directory of urqw.github.io.

GitHub Pages must be configured for this to work. To do this, go to Settings, then Pages (under the Code and automation heading). You can also directly open the page at <https://github.com/urqw/UrqW/settings/pages>. On this page, under the Build and deployment heading in the Source menu, select "Deploy from a branch" and below the "master" branch and the "/ (root)" directory.
